## How Analytics Can Predict Machine Failure

Predictive maintenance is a revolutionary concept within the agriculture industry. Harnessing the power of data and analytics with the use of connected technology and sensors allows farmers to increase yield and profit as well as decrease equipment repair costs and machine downtime.  

Let’s focus in on the cotton production industry for example, specifically the use of the Cotton Gin. Cotton gins are game-changing to the production process. It only takes around 90 seconds to process a 500-pound cotton bale through a gin to separate the seeds from the fibers. The faster the gins run, the better because this increases yield meaning increased profits overall for the ginners.

During peak ginning season, gins are run heavily to produce cleaned bales of cotton at rapid speeds but despite best efforts to manage routine maintenance activities on these gins, unplanned equipment failure can occur. These unplanned events can be catastrophic, and revenue could potentially take a huge hit depending on the amount of damage done. This can completely halt production in some instances causing high levels of stress to the entire organization that must now come up with a quick fix. 

In comes predictive maintenance. Ginners can find new ways to improve Gin decisions by using the data already being collected from the gins and a variety of different data science methods to not only limit the number of chokes but to also identify areas where predictive maintenance might be needed and what is causing it to occur in the first place. 

## Let’s First Start with the Data
An enormous amount of data is already being collected and streamed off gins today, measuring several different parameters like the number of bales of cotton produced per hour, how much electricity is used to produce a single bale, and the moisture levels of the cotton itself. Due to the nature of sensor data, the reality is that much of this data is either heavily siloed or even just simply missing, making it a real challenge for ginners to analyze properly. Without sufficient data, it’s hard to gauge the overall performance of the gin and sometimes even challenging to identify areas on the gin where non-routine maintenance might be needed. Our question now becomes how we collect and transform this data in a way where we can capture the most value from the data flowing through the gin to help reduce unplanned downtime and overall maintenance costs.

The solution: Applying advanced analytical tools and techniques to the problem before a failure occurs. Using an [AI-embedded IoT solution](https://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/documents/product-collateral/fact-sheets/en/sas-analytics-for-iot-108219.pdf), we can take all those disparate data sources that are being collected by our sensors and bring them into a single point of access to extract only the relevant information that we need for analysis. By doing this, we create that perfect master or “golden” dataset that can be surfaced through operational dashboards that will help us to start uncovering some of those hidden patterns in our data or even jump straight to developing predictive models with our new dataset to predict machine failure.  

Not only does this tool provide an intuitive point-and-click interface that enables all users to select and transform data, but it also provides a continuous flow of data into the application that ginners can use to gain a better understand the performance of the gin overtime. As data continues to flow in, it can be used to help identify various metrics from the gin that can be tweaked to improve the overall ginning process.

## Analyzing Sensor Data
Now that the data is ready and continues to flow in the platform in real time, we can apply analytics to the process before the gin starts running outside of its normal limits and potentially causing a choke in the machine. By implementing a predictive model, it will be able to pick up on that historical data that is being fed in and it starts to recognize specific patterns from prior failures occurring. It can then warn users by setting up alerts to be sent that tells users the asset will likely fail or fall out of spec based on this information. Not only can we get alerts before a failure occurs, but now we also can get more detail around the specific attributes that contribute most to machine failure and the specific values each parameter is.  

The use of analytics to ginners is no doubt significant for several reasons.  First and foremost a large benefit is being able to anticipate a failure and having the ability to switch out a defective part before a complete shutdown happens and halts production. Using an analytics first approach is also beneficial for preemptive corrective actions, increasing asset life and controlling costs while managing downtime and maximizing uptime.  

Maintenance can play a huge role in an organizations overall business strategy. If streaming gin data is utilized to its full potential, this will allow ginners to become more proactive in their approach to maintenance by maximizing the performance of the asset while reducing downtime and maintenance costs overall
